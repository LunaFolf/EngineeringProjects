# ðŸª«VR Gadget DockðŸ”‹

A Docking station/hub for charging VR peripherals.

---

Why? Because I'm sick of the jank setup I have for charging my two controllers and three body trackers, and if more peripherals come along in the future my USB hub won't be sufficient anymore.

I want a dock style system where the unit already has male adapters on it, so I can just plug my devices in - makes stuff cleaner, with no cables dangling about.

Of course, for future compatability, I might want to investigate adding some additional female ports _somewhere_ on the dock...
